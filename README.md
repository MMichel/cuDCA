cuDCA
=====

CUDA implementation of the initial steps of direct coupling analysis
(DCA). Given a multiple sequence alignment, the tool calculates
residue frequencies and the covariance matrix as described in
"[PSICOV: precise structural contact prediction using sparse inverse
covariance estimation on large multiple sequence
alignments.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22101153)"
