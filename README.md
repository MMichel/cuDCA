cuDCA
=====

CUDA implementation of the initial steps of direct coupling analysis
(DCA). Given a multiple sequence alignment, the tool calculates
residue frequencies and the covariance matrix as described in
"[Improved contact prediction in proteins: Using pseudolikelihoods to
infer Potts models](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1211.1281.pdf)"
